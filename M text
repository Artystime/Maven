# Question 2: Automatic Build of Java Project using GitHub Actions & Maven

---

## Step 1: Install Java (Prerequisite)

```cmd
java -version
```

Installed JDK 21 and verified Java installation.

---

## Step 2: Download and Install Maven

1. Downloaded Maven from: [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
2. Extracted to:

```
C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.9.12
```

---

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

### Added System Variable:

```
MAVEN_HOME = C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.9.12
```

### Updated PATH:

```
%MAVEN_HOME%\bin
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Maven Installation

```cmd
mvn -version
```

Output:

```
Apache Maven 3.9.12
Java version: 21
```

---

## Step 5: Create Java Maven Project

```cmd
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.college -DartifactId=website -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

```cmd
cd website
mvn clean install
```

Result: **BUILD SUCCESS**

---

## Step 6: Create GitHub Repository

Created new repository:

```
java-ci-project
```

---

## Step 7: Push Java Project to GitHub

```cmd
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Java Maven project"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/java-ci-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 8: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Created folders:

```cmd
mkdir .github
mkdir .github\workflows
```

Created file:

```
.github/workflows/maven-build.yml
```

---

## Step 9: Add Workflow Code

```yaml
name: Java CI with Maven

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up JDK
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean install
```

---

## Step 10: Push Workflow to GitHub

```cmd
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline"
git push
```

---

## Step 11: Verify Automatic Build

1. Opened GitHub repository
2. Opened **Actions** tab
3. Observed workflow running automatically on push

---

## Step 12: Test Auto Trigger

```cmd
git commit -am "Test auto build"
git push
```

Build triggered automatically again ✅

---

# Final Result

✔ Java project pushed to GitHub
✔ Maven installed and configured
✔ GitHub Actions CI pipeline created
✔ Automatic build on every push implemented
