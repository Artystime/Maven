# Q2) Automate Build & Packaging of Employee Management Application using GitHub Actions

---

## Step 1: Push Application Code to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Employee Management App"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/employee-management.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 2: Create Dockerfile

Create file **Dockerfile** in project root:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/employee-app.jar app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

---

## Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create folders:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create file:

```bash
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

---

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Actions Pipeline

Paste:

```yaml
name: Employee App CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-dockerize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Build Application
      run: mvn clean package

    - name: Build Docker Image
      run: docker build -t employee-app:latest .
```

---

## Step 5: Push Workflow to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions pipeline"
git push
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Pipeline Execution

1. Open GitHub repository
2. Go to **Actions tab**
3. Select workflow **Employee App CI Pipeline**
4. Check all steps are ✔️ successful

---

## Final Verification

Pipeline should show:

✔ Code checkout
✔ Java setup
✔ Application build
✔ Docker image creation

---

# Expected Outcome (Write in exam)

* Basic DevOps CI pipeline created
* Automated build using GitHub Actions
* Docker image generated automatically

---

# Diagram (Optional for exam)

```
Developer → GitHub Repo → GitHub Actions
                         ↓
                    Build App
                         ↓
                    Docker Image
```
