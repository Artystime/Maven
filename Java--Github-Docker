A company wants to automate build and packaging of its **Employee Management application**.
# 🏗️ Step 1 – Create Sample Application

Create a folder:

```
employee-management-app
```

Create file **Main.java**

``

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello from Docker!");
    }
}

# 🐳 Step 2 – Create Dockerfile

Create file **Dockerfile** (no extension)

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN javac Main.java

CMD ["java", "Main"]
```

---

# 🚫 Step 3 – Create .dockerignore

Create file named **.dockerignore**

```
*.class
.git
.github
```

---

# 🌐 Step 4 – Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **New repository**
3. Name: employee-management-app
4. Public → Create

---

# 📤 Step 5 – Push Code to GitHub

Open terminal in project folder:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Employee management app"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/employee-management-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

# ⚙️ Step 6 – Create GitHub Actions Pipeline

Create folders:

```
.github/workflows
```

Create file:

```
docker-build.yml
```

Paste:

```yaml
name: Build Employee App Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t employee-app .

    - name: Show Docker images
      run: docker images
```

---

# 📤 Step 7 – Push Pipeline Files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions pipeline"
git push
```

---

# ✅ Step 8 – Verify Pipeline

1. Open repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Open latest workflow
4. Ensure **green tick**

---



The Employee Management application source code was pushed to a GitHub repository. A Dockerfile was created to containerize the application. GitHub Actions was configured using a workflow file to automatically build the application and generate a Docker image on every push to the main branch. The pipeline execution was verified successfully from the GitHub Actions dashboard, demonstrating automated build and container creation.

# 🗺️ Architecture Diagram

```
Developer → GitHub Repo → GitHub Actions → Docker Build → Image Created
```

---

# 🎤 Viva Ready Lines

* GitHub Actions is used for CI
* Dockerfile defines container steps
* Image is built on cloud runner
* Pipeline triggers on push

---

# 🏁 Completed Outcome

✔ Source code in GitHub
✔ CI pipeline configured
✔ Docker image created
✔ Automation verified
